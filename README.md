Scratch can't run this project at a good fps, and it's just to complicated for Scratch to run.
I've decided to redo the game in another engine I made, this one using better metadata engine.
It should be faster, with better graphics, and able to run on Scratch.

You can find the current version (v2) of the game here - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1069052172
and you can find the V1 engine here - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/93457040
