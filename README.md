This is a game I'm making in Scratch. It's an underwater game, like Subnautica, but 2D.

I've redone the game in another engine I made, this one using better metadata engine. It's faster, with better graphics, and able to run on Scratch.
I'm working on a v3 engine, this one with line collision, and higher resolution maps.

You can find the current version (v2) of the game here - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1069052172 and you can find the v1 engine here - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/93457040.
v3 engine in development right now!
