Scratch can't run this project at a good fps, and it's just to complicated for Scratch to run.
I've decided to redo the game in another engine I made, this one using better metadata engine.
It should be faster, with better graphics, and able to run on Scratch.

You can find the current version of the game here - scratch.mit.edu/projects/934570407
And you can find the V2 engine here - scratch.mit.edu/projects/1069052172
