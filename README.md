This is a game I'm making in Scratch. It's an underwater game, like Subnautica, but 2D.

I've redone the game in another engine I made, this one using better metadata engine. It's faster, with better graphics, and able to run on Scratch.
I'm working on a v3 engine, this one with line collision, and higher resolution maps.
